# Instructions --------------------------------------------------

# With data extraction being a routine task, the ideal for such a workflow is to automate it.
# With the availability of APIs and database back-ends, it's possible to automate your data extraction and processing


# In this homework, think of a Research study that stores their clinical data in a REDCap database and lab data
# in a MySQL or SQL database.

# Automating data extraction and process for such a study design enhances efficiency and promotes productivity among
# the Data Management teams.

# Using CRON jobs, it's possible to schedule tasks that contain pre-written R scripts for data extraction and processing.
# This can be taken further into data cleaning and analysis.

# Task: Create a CRON job in Posit cloud (formerly Rstudio cloud) and specify the following paramters and files

# 1. What R script(s) should be automated
# 2. How often is the CRON executed (choose a schedule based on the size of the task)
# 3. What logs to be monitored. Logs help you check the success of the CRON jobs and state of the automated tasks.


# This homework has been implemented in a real study before, so if interests you and you need to consult further,
# feel free to reach the author of the implementation `marongachristopher@gmail.com`


# Good Luck!
